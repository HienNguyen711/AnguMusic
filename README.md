# AnguMusic
## What is this?
This is a personal app I created when I studied Angular2. It took me 48hours to learn the basic concepts of A2, read the documentation from http://angular.io/ and applied all the basic concepts of A2 to this app. I also have experience with A1 for 6months, stop learning it for 2 months to move forward with ReactJS and now comback to pick up A2.

## Tech used:
+ A2 
+ TS, ES6 
+ OAuth 
+ Data fetching from API
+ Restful 


## Plan for further improvement
+ Server rendering in A2
